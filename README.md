SITE Pre-Work Submission
Name: [Ezequiel Soler]

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. [I didn’t use any resource outside of the guide that was provided by CodePath.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [A challenge that I encountered with this submission was the colors for the buttons. At the beginning of this project, I was asked to create four buttons and there was a guide provided on the colors I could choose. From there I was able to choose four colors and make the project as good as I want. The issue only arose later when I decided to make this game more complex and complete one of the optional features and added more buttons. I decided to work with nine instead of eight buttons. Making the game much more complex and it would extend the game much faster. The issue with having nine buttons is choosing nine colors. I had to choose nine-light colors for when the user first sees the game and then nine dark colors so when the user clicks on the button they know the button is being clicked. The reason this was an issue was the limited color options. The way that I overcame this was to have the buttons repeat the same color category but ensure the two buttons that came from the same color category had a different shade. For Example button two and button seven had different colors at first but for the user, the colors seemed to resemble each other. To rectify it, I had to go back to the guide and went back to the color category for blue. For button two I chose “deepskyblue” for the background and when the user clicked on it the color changed to “blue”. For button seven the background color is “powder blue” and when the user clicks on the button the color changes to “midnight blue”]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) [After completing the submission some questions that I have for web development are how drastic can the style of the program look? I spent some time changing the colors to fit my ideal color scheme but I want to know how crazy can someone get with this? Can they change the font and use images instead of the actual text in case a word they would like to be displayed cannot be displayed in the user’s preferred font? Another question I have is what else can web development offer besides creating games? I spent some time doing web programming at my school and all we worked on was creating our website based on a topic we chose. My website was not perfect and neither was the class especially when we transitioned to remote learning at the beginning of this pandemic. This game was only the second time I ever worked on anything web development-related. So I want to know what else is possible for us to create in such a course.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) [If I had been given more house to work on this project I would spend that time working on how I can make this game more fun. I know that one of the optional features was to use a Math.random function but because of my limited knowledge I decided not to work on that optional feature. I want to know if there are more things I could do. I was thinking of adding a function that could calculate the number of points. Based on the number of buttons and the pattern the game followed there would be a set number of maximum points you could receive and once the game starts you could see on the top a scoreboard calculating the number of points you get. Also, I would have liked to add a board that would give you an X for every button you miss. Once you miss three of them the game is over. If possible I would also like to add a bonus round where once the player finished the main game a bonus round would be available for the user to increase their points. With this in mind, I think it would also have been crucial to allow the user to save their score and have their friends play as well so they can become competitive and try to score the highest point.]
